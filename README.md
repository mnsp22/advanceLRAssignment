## Predicting House Prices in the Australian Market: A Regression Model with Regularization
## Introduction
A US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, aims to enter the Australian real estate market. Their strategy involves purchasing houses below their actual values and selling them at a higher price. To achieve this, they've collected a dataset from house sales in Australia. In this README, we'll build a regression model using regularization techniques to predict the actual value of prospective properties. Our goal is to help Surprise Housing decide whether to invest in these properties.
Business GoalThe model we create will serve two main purposes:
- Predictive Power: We'll identify significant variables that influence house prices. By understanding these factors, Surprise Housing can make informed investment decisions.
- Pricing Dynamics: The model will shed light on how house prices vary with independent variables. This knowledge will allow the management to fine-tune their strategy and focus on areas with high return potential.
DataThe dataset contains information about various houses in Australia.
ApproachWe'll use regularization techniques to build our regression model. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Specifically, we'll explore two common regularization methods:
- L2 Regularization (Ridge Regression):
- L1 Regularization (Lasso Regression):

Implementation Steps- Data Preprocessing:
    - Load the dataset.
    - Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
    - Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Feature Selection:
    - Identify relevant features (variables) that significantly impact house prices.
    - Use techniques like feature importance or correlation analysis.
- Model Building:
    - Fit a linear regression model (without regularization) to establish a baseline.
    - Implement ridge regression and lasso regression using Scikit-Learn.
    - Tune the hyperparameter (\lambda) for both methods.
- Model Evaluation:
    - Evaluate the models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
    - Compare the performance of ridge and lasso regression.
- Optimal (\lambda) Selection:
    - Use cross-validation to find the best (\lambda) for ridge and lasso.
    - Plot the regularization paths to visualize the impact of (\lambda) on coefficients.
- Interpretation:
    - Examine the coefficients to understand which features contribute most to house prices.
ConclusionBy following this approach, Surprise Housing can make informed investment decisions based on the predictive power of our regression model. Additionally, understanding the pricing dynamics will help them tailor their strategy effectively.
